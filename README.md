# QCancer<sup>&reg;</sup> Explanation

This web application aims to explain the QCancer<sup>&reg;</sup> algorithm which predicts cancer risks for males and females of the age between 25 and 89 in the UK (more information on https://qcancer.org/).

This app provides a **counterfactual explanation** (in graphical and textual forms) as well as the standard **SHAP explanation**, both of which are local explanations (i.e. with respect to the given input).
